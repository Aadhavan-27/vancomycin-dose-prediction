# vancomycin-dose-prediction

This project aims to develop a personalized dosage prediction and monitoring sys- tem for the antibiotic Vancomycin, which is used to treat severe Gram-positive infections such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin dosing requires careful monitoring, as maintaining the drug concentration within its narrow therapeutic win- dow is essential to avoid toxicity and ensure clinical effectiveness. Traditional pharmacoki- netic approaches, though widely used, are limited in capturing the variability between pa- tients caused by factors such as age, weight, and kidney function. To address these chal- lenges, this project integrates pharmacokinetic modeling with machine learning techniques to simulate patient-specific responses and predict vancomycin concentration levels. The sys- tem utilizes clinically relevant features such as age, weight, serum creatinine, dosing interval, and infusion time to estimate trough concentrations and recommend suitable dosage adjust- ments. By combining pharmacological knowledge with data-driven modeling, this study proposes a framework for personalized therapeutic drug monitoring, supporting safer and more efficient antibiotic dosing decisions in clinical practice.
